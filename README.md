# Connect-Four-Refactored


**
What this assignment was about: 

This was an assignment to refactor boiler plate Connect Four game code provided into OOP. 
The point was to begin working with an object oriented programming paradigm.  

**
What I did: 

I created a Game class and refactored all of the code so every variable was now a class attribute and every function was now 
an object method of the game class.
I then created aÂ player class and had the game keep track of the player object rather than the player number. 
I used 2 text fields to collect user input so each players' piece colors could be set dynamically, and then used the click 
of a start button for the user to begin the game. 
I also added functionality so that upon the game ending, no more pieces can be added to the game board. 

** 
What I learned: 

I had a very hard time with this. This project was my first time taking advantage of TA help, as I often couldn't wrap my head
around what "this" was, and how to effectively/properly use the .bind() method to get what I wanted. 
I did learn however that object oriented code can look very clean and modular, allowing for relevant functions and info to be 
grouped together. 

** 
Looking forward: 

I will likely spend more time consuming what resources are publically available to me on OOP, so that when I work on new 
projects, I can take full advantage of the flexibility this paradigm offers.
